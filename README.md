# hangman
A simple, terminal based, guess the word game written in Python 3.6

This project was built from scratch as a python 3.6 learning exercise.

I took the easy to implement idea of a guess a mystery word, and used it to learn the python language as I went by adding more and more functionality. 

The initial master branch commit of hangman.py is a fully functional version with a list of 10 words, chosen randomlly at launch. The first major ui feature, terminal colors with colorama, is already implemened in the first commit.

I will be growing this project as time goes on by implementing features documented in he issue log.

This is a personal learning project for now. I will only be commiting my own code to this repo.
I made this a public repository so others could view, clone, or downlod the code to play with.

As I mentioned before, the entire point of this project is for me to learn, so in that spirt, your comments and suggestions are encuraged and appreciated! 

Disclaimer:
I am not new to programming, but I am new to Python, and github, and I am learning best practices as I go.
